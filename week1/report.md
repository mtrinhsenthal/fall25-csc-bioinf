STEPS

1 - Set up repository structure and CI according to guidelines
2 - Clone the original repository and recreate the N50 values with my own n50.py file
3 - Convert main.py, dbg.py and utils.py to Codon. I started by copying the original Python, ran it with Codon, and solved errors (mostly type issues) as they came, until there were no more errors.
4 - Write the evaluate.sh bash script to run both Python and Codon code, and output the results in a table.


TRICKY PARTS

1 - I would get 'Segmentation fault: 11' when I ran 'python main.py data4' on my local machine - the solution was to run using python3
2 - Initially I tried to use AI models to convert from Python to Codon, but found that they struggled, and confused me. It turned out to be easier and faster to do it myself by directly copying over the Python code and debugging errors one-by-one; I found that I understood the code better that way anyways
3 - I have never used CI in GitHub before, so it took me a while to understand it. Reading other students' questions on Piazza helped - especially the tip that I had to add Codon to PATH in my script (export PATH="${HOME}/.codon/bin:$PATH"), I struggled before finding this
4 - In my final output, I am able to output all of the N50 values except for the one generated by the Python version of the code on data4. I am still not sure why this is not working.


RESULTS
The Codon and Python code seem to produce the same results, but the Codon code runs noticeably faster.
